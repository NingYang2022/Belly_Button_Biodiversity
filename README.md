# Belly Button Biodiversity

## <font color=#6495ED>Overview of Project</font>
The human body is source of thousands of types of bacteria, and different parts of the body harbor different species. Bacteria found in the gut are not the same species that are found on person’s eyelashes. Furthermore, between individuals the bacterial species may vary even in the same location. 


We hypothesize that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef maybe found in the belly button, or at least I someone’s belly button. To test the hypothesis, we had someone to sample the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. Each person’s identity is anonymous. They had been assigned an ID number. 

Now we need to build the dashboard that both research participants and fellow researchers can access. Those who participated in the study will be able to visit a website and select their ID numbers to see which bacterial species live in their navels. 


### <font color=#6495D>Purposes</font>

1. Create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage
2. Create a bubble chart that will display information when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage
3. create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
4. Use HTML, Bootstrap, css file and javascript to customize the webpage for the dashboard.
