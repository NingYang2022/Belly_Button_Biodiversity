        <p>The human body is source of thousands of types of bacteria, and different parts of the body harbor different species. Bacteria found in the gut are not the same species that are found on person’s eyelashes. Furthermore, between individuals the bacterial species may vary even in the same location. <br><br>We hypothesize that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef maybe found in the belly button, or at least in someone’s belly button. To test the hypothesis, we had someone to sample the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. Each person’s identity is anonymous. They had been assigned an ID number.<br><br>Now we need to build the dashboard that both research participants and fellow researchers can access. Those who participated in the study will be able to visit a website and select their ID numbers to see which bacterial species live in their navels. <br><br>
